This script requires at least 16GB RAM.
It is designed for NERSC and uses hard-coded paths.

Description:  Removes all reads that map to the human genome with at least 95% identity after quality trimming.
Removes approximately 98.6% of human 2x150bp reads, with zero false-positives to non-animals.
NOTE!  This program uses hard-coded paths and will only run on Nersc systems unless you change the path.

Usage:  removehuman.sh in=<input file> outu=<clean output file>

Input may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.

Parameters:
threads=auto        (t) Set number of threads to use; default is number of logical processors.
overwrite=t         (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than overwrite an existing file.
interleaved=auto    (int) If true, forces fastq input to be paired and interleaved.
trim=t              Trim read ends to remove bases with quality below minq.
                    Values: t (trim both ends), f (neither end), r (right end only), l (left end only).
untrim=t            Undo the trimming after mapping.
minq=4              Trim quality threshold.
ziplevel=2          (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression level; lower compression is faster.
outm=<file>         File to output the reads that mapped to human.
path=               Set the path to an indexed human genome.
