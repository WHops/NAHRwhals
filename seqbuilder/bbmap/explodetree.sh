Description:   Constructs a directory and file tree of sequences
corresponding to a taxonomic tree.

Usage:  explodetree.sh in=<file> out=<path> tree=<file>

Parameters:
in=             A fasta file annotated with taxonomic data in headers, 
                such as modified RefSeq.
out=            (path) Location to write the tree.
tree=           Location of taxtree file.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
