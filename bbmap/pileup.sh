Description:  Calculates per-scaffold or per-base coverage information from an unsorted sam or bam file.
Supports SAM/BAM format for reads and FASTA for reference.
Sorting is not needed, so output may be streamed directly from a mapping program.
Requires a minimum of 1 bit per reference base plus 100 bytes per scaffold (even if no reference is specified).
If per-base coverage is needed (including for stdev and median), at least 4 bytes per base is needed.

Usage:        pileup.sh in=<input> out=<output>

Input Parameters:
in=<file>           The input sam file; this is the only required parameter.
ref=<file>          Scans a reference fasta for per-scaffold GC counts, not otherwise needed.
fastaorf=<file>     An optional fasta file with ORF header information in PRODIGAL's output format.  Must also specify 'outorf'.
unpigz=t            Decompress with pigz for faster decompression.
addfromref=t        Allow ref scaffolds not present in sam header to be added from the reference.
addfromreads=f      Allow ref scaffolds not present in sam header to be added from the reads.
                    Note that in this case the ref scaffold lengths will be inaccurate.

Output Parameters:
out=<file>          (covstats) Per-scaffold coverage info.
rpkm=<file>         Per-scaffold RPKM/FPKM counts.
twocolumn=f         Change to true to print only ID and Avg_fold instead of all 6 columns.
countgc=t           Enable/disable counting of read GC content.
outorf=<file>       Per-orf coverage info to this file (only if 'fastaorf' is specified).
outsam=<file>       Print the input sam stream to this file (or stdout).  Useful for piping data.
hist=<file>         Histogram of # occurrences of each depth level.
basecov=<file>      Coverage per base location.
bincov=<file>       Binned coverage per location (one line per X bases).
binsize=1000        Binsize for binned coverage output.
keepshortbins=t     (ksb) Keep residual bins shorter than binsize.
normcov=<file>      Normalized coverage by normalized location (X lines per scaffold).
normcovo=<file>     Overall normalized coverage by normalized location (X lines for the entire assembly).
normb=-1            If positive, use a fixed number of bins per scaffold; affects 'normcov' and 'normcovo'.
normc=f             Normalize coverage to fraction of max per scaffold; affects 'normcov' and 'normcovo'.
delta=f             Only print base coverage lines when the coverage differs from the previous base.
nzo=f               Only print scaffolds with nonzero coverage.
concise=f           Write 'basecov' in a more concise format.
header=t            (hdr) Include headers in output files.
headerpound=t       (#) Prepend header lines with '#' symbol.
stdev=t             Calculate coverage standard deviation.
covminscaf=0        (minscaf) Don't print coverage for scaffolds shorter than this.
covwindow=0         Calculate how many bases are in windows of this size with
                    low average coverage.  Produces an extra stats column.
covwindowavg=5      Average coverage below this will be classified as low.
k=0                 If positive, calculate kmer coverage statstics for this kmer length.
keyvalue=f          Output statistics to screen as key=value pairs.
mincov=1            When calculating percent covered, ignore bases under this depth.

Processing Parameters:
strandedcov=f       Track coverage for plus and minus strand independently.
startcov=f          Only track start positions of reads.
stopcov=f           Only track stop positions of reads.
secondary=t         Use secondary alignments, if present.
softclip=f          Include soft-clipped bases in coverage.
minmapq=0           (minq) Ignore alignments with mapq below this.
physical=f          (physcov) Calculate physical coverage for paired reads.  This includes the unsequenced bases.
tlen=t              Track physical coverage from the tlen field rather than recalculating it.
arrays=auto         Set to t/f to manually force the use of coverage arrays.  Arrays and bitsets are mutually exclusive.
bitsets=auto        Set to t/f to manually force the use of coverage bitsets.
32bit=f             Set to true if you need per-base coverage over 64k; does not affect per-scaffold coverage precision.
                    This option will double RAM usage (when calculating per-base coverage).
delcoverage=t       (delcov) Count bases covered by deletions or introns as covered.
                    True is faster than false.
dupecoverage=t      (dupes) Include reads flagged as duplicates in coverage.
samstreamer=t       (ss) Load reads multithreaded to increase speed.

Trimming Parameters: 
** NOTE: These are applied before adding coverage, to allow mimicking **
** tools like CallVariants, which uses 'qtrim=r trimq=10 border=5'    **
qtrim=f             Quality-trim.  May be set to:
                       f (false): Don't quality-trim.
                       r (right): Trim right (3') end only.
                       l (left): Trim right (5') end only.
                       rl (both): Trim both ends.
trimq=-1            If positive, quality-trim to this threshold.
border=0            Ignore this many bases on the left and right end.

Output format (tab-delimited):
ID, Avg_fold, Length, Ref_GC, Covered_percent, Covered_bases, Plus_reads, Minus_reads, Read_GC, Median_fold, Std_Dev

ID:                Scaffold ID
Length:            Scaffold length
Ref_GC:            GC ratio of reference
Avg_fold:          Average fold coverage of this scaffold
Covered_percent:   Percent of scaffold with any coverage (only if arrays or bitsets are used)
Covered_bases:     Number of bases with any coverage (only if arrays or bitsets are used)
Plus_reads:        Number of reads mapped to plus strand
Minus_reads:       Number of reads mapped to minus strand
Read_GC:           Average GC ratio of reads mapped to this scaffold
Median_fold:       Median fold coverage of this scaffold (only if arrays are used)
Std_Dev:           Standard deviation of coverage (only if arrays are used)

Java Parameters:

-Xmx               This will set Java's memory usage, overriding 
                   autodetection. -Xmx20g will 
                   specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.  
                   The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom              This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                   exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da                Disable assertions.
