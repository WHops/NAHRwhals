Description:  Generates statistics about flowcell positions.

Usage:	plotflowcell.sh in=<input> out=<output>

Input parameters:
in=<file>           Primary input file.
in2=<file>          Second input file for paired reads in two files.
indump=<file>       Specify an already-made dump file to use instead of
                    analyzing the input reads.
reads=-1            Process this number of reads, then quit (-1 means all).
interleaved=auto    Set true/false to override autodetection of the
                    input file as paired interleaved.

Output parameters:
out=<file>          Output file for filtered reads.
dump=<file>         Write a summary of quality information by coordinates.

Tile parameters:
xsize=500           Initial width of micro-tiles.
ysize=500           Initial height of micro-tiles.
size=               Allows setting xsize and ysize tot he same value.
target=800          Iteratively increase the size of micro-tiles until they
                    contain an average of at least this number of reads.

Other parameters:
trimq=-1            If set to a positive number, trim reads to that quality
                    level instead of filtering them.
qtrim=r             If trimq is positive, to quality trimming on this end
                    of the reads.  Values are r, l, and rl for right,
                    left, and both ends.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx                This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                    -Xmx20g will specify 20 GB of RAM; -Xmx200m will specify 
                    200 MB.  The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom               This flag will cause the process to exit if an
                    out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da                 Disable assertions.
