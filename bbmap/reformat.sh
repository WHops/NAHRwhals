Description:  Reformats reads to change ASCII quality encoding, interleaving, file format, or compression format.
Optionally performs additional functions such as quality trimming, subsetting, and subsampling.
Supports fastq, fasta, fasta+qual, scarf, oneline, sam, bam, gzip, bz2.
Please read bbmap/docs/guides/ReformatGuide.txt for more information.

Usage:  reformat.sh in=<file> in2=<file2> out=<outfile> out2=<outfile2>

in2 and out2 are for paired reads and are optional.
If input is paired and there is only one output file, it will be written interleaved.

Parameters and their defaults:

ow=f                    (overwrite) Overwrites files that already exist.
app=f                   (append) Append to files that already exist.
zl=4                    (ziplevel) Set compression level, 1 (low) to 9 (max).
int=f                   (interleaved) Determines whether INPUT file is considered interleaved.
fastawrap=70            Length of lines in fasta output.
fastareadlen=0          Set to a non-zero number to break fasta files into reads of at most this length.
fastaminlen=1           Ignore fasta reads shorter than this.
qin=auto                ASCII offset for input quality.  May be 33 (Sanger), 64 (Illumina), or auto.
qout=auto               ASCII offset for output quality.  May be 33 (Sanger), 64 (Illumina), or auto (same as input).
qfake=30                Quality value used for fasta to fastq reformatting.
qfin=<.qual file>       Read qualities from this qual file, for the reads coming from 'in=<fasta file>'
qfin2=<.qual file>      Read qualities from this qual file, for the reads coming from 'in2=<fasta file>'
qfout=<.qual file>      Write qualities from this qual file, for the reads going to 'out=<fasta file>'
qfout2=<.qual file>     Write qualities from this qual file, for the reads coming from 'out2=<fasta file>'
outsingle=<file>        (outs) If a read is longer than minlength and its mate is shorter, the longer one goes here.
deleteinput=f           Delete input upon successful completion.
ref=<file>              Optional reference fasta for sam processing.

Processing Parameters:

verifypaired=f          (vpair) When true, checks reads to see if the names look paired.  Prints an error message if not.
verifyinterleaved=f     (vint) sets 'vpair' to true and 'interleaved' to true.

tossbrokenreads=f       (tbr) Discard reads that have different numbers of bases and qualities.  By default this will be detected and cause a crash.
ignorebadquality=f      (ibq) Fix out-of-range quality values instead of crashing with a warning.
addslash=f              Append ' /1' and ' /2' to read names, if not already present.  Please include the flag 'int=t' if the reads are interleaved.
spaceslash=t            Put a space before the slash in addslash mode.
addcolon=f              Append ' 1:' and ' 2:' to read names, if not already present.  Please include the flag 'int=t' if the reads are interleaved.

skipreads=-1            Skip (discard) this many INPUT reads before processing the rest.
samplerate=1            Randomly output only this fraction of reads; 1 means sampling is disabled.
sampleseed=-1           Set to a positive number to use that prng seed for sampling (allowing deterministic sampling).
samplereadstarget=0     (srt) Exact number of OUTPUT reads (or pairs) desired.
samplebasestarget=0     (sbt) Exact number of OUTPUT bases desired.
                        Important: srt/sbt flags should not be used with stdin, samplerate, qtrim, minlength, or minavgquality.
upsample=f              Allow srt/sbt to upsample (duplicate reads) when the target is greater than input.
prioritizelength=f      If true, calculate a length threshold to reach the target, and retain all reads of at least that length (must set srt or sbt).

Trimming and filtering parameters:

qtrim=f                 Trim read ends to remove bases with quality below trimq.
                        Values: t (trim both ends), f (neither end), r (right end only), l (left end only), w (sliding window).

maxmapq=-1              If non-negative, toss reads with mapq over this.
requiredbits=0          (rbits) Toss sam lines with any of these flag bits unset.  Similar to samtools -f.
filterbits=0            (fbits) Toss sam lines with any of these flag bits set.  Similar to samtools -F.
stoptag=f               Set to true to write a tag indicating read stop location, prefixed by YS:i:
sam=                    Set to 'sam=1.3' to convert '=' and 'X' cigar symbols (from sam 1.4+ format) to 'M'.
                        Set to 'sam=1.4' to convert 'M' to '=' and 'X' (sam=1.4 requires MD tags to be present, or ref to be specified).

Sam and bam alignment filtering options:
These require = and X symbols in cigar strings, or MD tags, or a reference fasta.
-1 means disabled; to filter reads with any of a symbol type, set to 0.

subfilter=-1            Discard reads with more than this many substitutions.

cardinality=f           (loglog) Count unique kmers using the LogLog algorithm.
loglogbuckets=1999      Use this many buckets for cardinality estimation.

Shortcuts: 
The # symbol will be substituted for 1 and 2.  The % symbol in out will be substituted for input name minus extensions.
For example:
reformat.sh in=read#.fq out=%.fa
...is equivalent to:
reformat.sh in1=read1.fq in2=read2.fq out1=read1.fa out2=read2.fa

Java Parameters:
-Xmx                    This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                        -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                        The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom                   This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da                     Disable assertions.
