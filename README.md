# NAHRwhals (NAHR-directed Workflow for catcHing seriAL Structural Variations)
An R package providing tools for simulation, detection and visualization of complex, NAHR-driven rearrangements. This includes:
		- Liftover of coordinates between arbitrary human DNA assemblies
		- Accurate sequence alignments of multi-MB DNA sequences
		- Dotplot visualizations 
		- BitLocus - condensed dotplots
		- A tree-based caller for complex, nested NAHR-mediated rearrangements.
