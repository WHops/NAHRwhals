\title{Generate a grid of x and y coordinates for a bitlocus plot.}
\usage{
make_xy_grid(paf, n_additional_bounces = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{paf}{a dataframe of alignments which is in paf-like format.}

\item{n_additional_bounces}{The number of additional times the points are bounced.}
}
\value{
A list containing the x and y coordinates of the grid, and a logical indicating whether the grid was successfully generated or not.
}
\description{
This function takes a PAF file, and generates a grid of x and y coordinates for a
bitlocus plot. The grid is generated by first bouncing the start and end points of
each alignment in the PAF file, and then bouncing the resulting points a few more
times. The bounced points are then collected, and the unique points are returned
as the x and y coordinates of the grid.
